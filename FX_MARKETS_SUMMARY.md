# FX Markets Page - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the implementation plan for adding a new FX markets page to display analytics for currency pairs from OANDA, including funding rates from a postgres database and a cross-correlation matrix for currency pairs.

## Completed Work

1. **Technical Specification** - Created detailed technical specification document
2. **Implementation Plan** - Created comprehensive implementation plan with code examples
3. **Database Schema Analysis** - Analyzed the provided funding rates schema and existing database structure
4. **API Design** - Designed RESTful API endpoints for funding rates and correlation matrix data
5. **UI/UX Design** - Planned the user interface components and user experience flow

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Connection Logic

- Extended `lib/db.ts` to include funding rates query functions
- Created helper functions for retrieving funding rates and currency pairs

### 2. API Routes

- `/api/fx/funding-rates` - Endpoint to fetch funding rates from the database
- `/api/fx/correlation-matrix` - Endpoint to calculate and return correlation matrix data

### 3. UI Components

- Main FX markets page with tabbed interface
- Funding rates display panel with data table
- Correlation matrix visualization with heatmap
- Time period selector for correlation analysis

## Implementation Files

### New Files to Create:

```
app/
  fx-markets/
    page.tsx                 # Main FX markets page component
api/
  fx/
    funding-rates/
      route.ts              # Funding rates API endpoint
    correlation-matrix/
      route.ts              # Correlation matrix API endpoint
lib/
  fx-utils.ts               # FX-specific utility functions (if needed)
```

### Files to Modify:

```
lib/db.ts                  # Add funding rates database functions
```

## Technical Details

### Database Queries

- Query funding rates with JOINs to assets and exchanges tables
- Retrieve closing prices for correlation calculations
- Handle filtering by broker (OANDA) and currency pairs

### Correlation Calculation

- Implement Pearson correlation coefficient algorithm
- Align data to common dates for accurate correlation
- Handle missing data scenarios

### Data Visualization

- Use Plotly.js for interactive heatmap visualization
- Color-code correlations (red for negative, green for positive)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Next Steps

### Implementation Phase

1. Create the database connection functions in `lib/db.ts`
2. Implement the funding rates API endpoint
3. Implement the correlation matrix API endpoint
4. Create the main FX markets page component
5. Add UI components for data display and interaction
6. Implement data visualization for the correlation matrix
7. Add error handling and loading states
8. Test with sample data
9. Optimize performance for large datasets
10. Document implementation and usage

### Testing Considerations

- Verify database queries return expected data
- Test correlation calculations with known datasets
- Check UI responsiveness on different devices
- Validate error handling for various scenarios
- Performance test with 68 currency pairs

## Dependencies

- `pg` for PostgreSQL database connections
- `react-plotly.js` for correlation matrix visualization
- `next/dynamic` for dynamic component imports
- Existing UI components from the project

## Estimated Timeline

- Database connection and API routes: 2-3 days
- UI components and visualization: 3-4 days
- Testing and optimization: 2-3 days
- Documentation: 1 day

Total estimated time: 8-11 days for complete implementation
